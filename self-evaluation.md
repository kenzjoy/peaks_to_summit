## How confident do you feel with the content on Arrays so far?

So far, the slow build of all the information has been sitting well with me. I am using my notebook and google a bit to check my knowledge, but I am consistently finding that I am retaining the information pretty well.

## Is there any additional learning you need or want to do before moving to the next lesson?

I am feeling up to speed and ready to move on.

## What questions do you have about Arrays?

I am eager to dive deeper into the boolean concept and different formulas associated with them.
